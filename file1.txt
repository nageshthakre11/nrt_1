Lets start with Git and GitHub


step 1: clone the repository from the github 
			> git clone https://github.com/nageshthakre11/nrt_1.git

step 2: create own branch 
			> git branch nrt_branch_1
			
step 3: create new file and update the changes in that file 
			> touch 'new_file1.txt'

step 4: add that updated file to the stagging area
			> git add ./<filename>

step 5: review and do the commit of the added file 
			> git status
			> git commit -m "message of commit"

step 6: push the commited branch data to the github
			> git push origin nrt_branch_1

step 7: after pushing , raise a merge request from the git hub, approve it and merge it 
			> 

step 8: now you can find the approved file in the github acct 
			>

step 9: pull the updated new file from the git hub to the master/main using pull req
			> git pull origin

------------------------------JUST FOR PRACTICE: CREATED NEW BRANCH AND UPDATED THE NEW CHNAGES IN TEXT FILE -------------------------------------------

FALLOW THE SAME PROCESS ABOVE FROM NRT_BRANCH_2 

obeserving the same changes in the all branch 


new chnages are made from nrt_branch_1
